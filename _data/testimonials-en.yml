  quote: "The Sidetech experience with the Startup DEV was very good. It's proposed format is very productive because it uses techniques during the first meeting which gives an overview of the project, even before you start it. The points system gives you the flexibility to define what is really a priority and you can develop the rest later, when customers or investors take an interest in your project. The staff is super responsible and development work was actually done in 48 hours."
