  quote: "I want to say I was surprised. During two weeks of Mobile Startup Dev, the team have taught a class in project management. We thought that maybe the scope was too big, but in the end everything worked out . Besides, they delivered one thing that is very important to us: the 'Wow' factor! Today I look at the app and say, 'Wow!'"

  quote: "What caught my attention the most was how focused the team worked from the first meeting about the project. The deadlines set at the beggining have been rigorously met. The suggestions presented, when each member of the team showed their screens, helped enrich the system and even though they were not applied, they kept the ‘heat’ of our thinking on the best possible functioning of the system."
