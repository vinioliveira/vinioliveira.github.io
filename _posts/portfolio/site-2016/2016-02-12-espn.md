about_text1:
- <strong>ESPN Brasil</strong> is online portal and one of Brazil's biggest cable television sports channel. With a responsive version, it solved several problems for mobile users, as they couldn't access the portal from their devices.
- <br>
- Project <i>is live</i> and being used by sports fans, breaking audience records in the first month after launch.
- <br>
- Being the great portal that it is, the idea was to replace pages one by one so users wouldn't feel the change. The portal today has 100% support for mobile devices.

customer_testimony:
- Every week we deployed new features to production. There has been a couple of partners in the IT community helping ESPN maintain the fast-paced editorial rhythm and HE:labs is one of these companies.

about_text2 :
- <strong>One of our big specialties is integrating systems.</strong>
- When ESPN Brazil, a giant in sports journalism, approached us to build their first mobile portal, it was a a huge chance to write some history. We ended up developing and integrating an entirely new mobile application within their existing CMS system in record time.
