about_text1:
- Development of ESPN Brasil's online portal and one of Brazil's biggest cable television sports channel. With a responsive version, it solved several problems for mobile users, as they couldn't access the portal from their devices.
- Project is live and being used by sports fans, breaking audience records in the first month after launch.
- Being the great portal that it is, the idea was to replace pages one by one so users wouldn't feel the change. The portal today has 100% support for mobile devices.

customer_testimony:
- Every week we deployed new features to production. There has been a couple of partners in the IT community helping ESPN maintain the fast-paced editorial rhythm and HE:labs is one of these companies.
