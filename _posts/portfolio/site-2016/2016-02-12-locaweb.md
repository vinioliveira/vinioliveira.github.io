about_text1:
- Locaweb is the leader web hosting company in Brazil. It offers many services, like server and cloud management, email servers, email marketing, e-commerce solutions and more.

customer_testimony:
- It was necessary to implement the app using our APIs , and HE:mobile accomplished this almost without questioning us Because of the work of HE:Mobile, now we can accelerate our backlog, and the experience with mobile devices was instrumental in achieving the results we expected
