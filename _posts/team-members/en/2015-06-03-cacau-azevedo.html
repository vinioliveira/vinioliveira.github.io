bio:
- Cacau has been drawing since she was a kid. She grew up and the design took place of her early sketches (six-footed dogs and spacesuits, mostly), in the shape of irresistible web pages and user experience oriented interfaces.
- She also loves graphic design, game design and to project spaces that make people feel happier. She still sketches on everything she can and blow some minds with coffee watercolors - it prevents insomnia!
