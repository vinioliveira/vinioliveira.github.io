bio:
- A fan of technology and news and fan of technology news. I like to see what I write become applications, and put it all to work.
- I started creating Websites, Systems, CMS, Virtual Stores and then Steve Jobs invented the iPhone, there was no way, I had to learn Mobile and learn to create apps. And here I am.
