bio:
- Karine has a degree in Modern Foreign Language with a PhD in Literature and Linguistics. After many years teaching and managing institutions ruled by traditional standards - always passionate about what was going on outside the walls, though - she decided to embrace new ideas, new ways.
- She likes challenges involving problem solving, thinking solutions, designing processes, integrating people. She believes that learning new things and inspiring people with simplicity and lightness are daily goals.
- She loves movies, tv series, books, animals, a house full of friends, long talks and wants to go around to get to know the world.
