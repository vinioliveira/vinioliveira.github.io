bio:
- Leandro has been working with mobile development since 2008. He had started with the "extinct" Blackberry, and moved to Android development 2 years later. He is curious and likes to start learning new things, although sometimes he doesn't end it. As he says, that's how learning is - it never ends. 
- In his leisure time, he likes to watch his favorite soccer team (Bahia), hang out with friend, or just play videogames. As a sports games fan, his best hobby is to beat his friends on FIFA, or his bosses on Pro Evolution Soccer.
