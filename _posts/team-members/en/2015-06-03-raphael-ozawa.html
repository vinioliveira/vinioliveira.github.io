bio:
- People tell me I’m a co-founder, but I know I’m actually a “Jack-of-All-Trades Designer”. User Experience? Graphic Design? User Interface? Visual Identity? Illustration? There I go give my tip to help the team. Here, the creation is never only mine, but I act as a shield that protect designers to make their lives easier. I just don’t have time for anything more. But I accept donations. ;)
