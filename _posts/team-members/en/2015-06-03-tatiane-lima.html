bio:
- She always thought that creating something was magical. When she was a child, inspired by the Beakman’s show, she wanted to be an inventor. When she grew up, found out that creativity and knowledge don’t needed a scientist's coat. She learned with design that paper and pencil were enough to create things and solve big problems.
- She loves internet, memes, cartoon, Bahia (her state) and Yakult, but what she really likes is people.
