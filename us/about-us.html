      <p class="mission-grid__description">
        Our relations are guided by transparency while always respecting everyone’s privacy. We do not worry about hiding our numbers and are transparent about the company’s actual status at any given moment.

      <p class="mission-grid__description">
        Our members are free to choose how to deal with the projects. We don’t have dress codes and everyone can work remotely. Our teams are self-organized and the communication between them and the client is direct, without middlemen.

      <p class="mission-grid__description">
        Our clients speak directly with our technical team, which in turn, are prepared to help and advise with excellence. We are programmers, designers and nerds, and we're capable of communicating and organizing ourselves very well. The teams find their own way of working, and do so without a boss or senior management.

      <p class="mission-grid__description">
        We are aware that work needs to be done in an iterative  and incremental fashion to achieve the best results. We use our review meetings to find what needs improvement, so we are able to act fast and develop outstanding products.

      <p class="mission-grid__description">
        Collaboration is essential for effective teamwork. Our collaborative spirit goes beyond HE:labs' boundaries, since we are always involved in the development community by sponsoring events, giving talks and creating open source tools.

      <h3 class="mission-grid__small-title">Trust</h3>
      <p class="mission-grid__description">
        Above all, we value people. We trust those whom we interact with. Even when in doubt, we trust.
        We trust the result of everyone’s work and respect their decisions. We don’t command and control, the absence of a main authority figure reflects this. We know we must be aligned on the purposes and can trust our team partners in this way so our results will be the best.

      <h3 class="mission-grid__small-title">Courage</h3>
      <p class="mission-grid__description">
        Beyond all, we need courage to do what we do. Here we get it done differently and sail against the tide. Our vision goes beyond common sense. To implement our beliefs, it’s necessary a bit of courage every day at work. We have enough of it to make a difference, to invent and innovate. We also use it to say no to clients and to decline doing things we know will be harmful, even if they think the opposite.

      <p class="mission-grid__description">
        We love what we do and our main goal is to make our clients and their users happy by delivering the most functional and well designed product. We always ask our clients if, more than satisfied, they are happy with our work. For us, joyfulness is the most relevant aspect of a job well done.

      <h3 class="mission-grid__small-title">Awesomeness</h3>
      <p class="mission-grid__description">
        Unfortunately, the word “work” has taken on a shady and pejorative sense in Brazil. Some people go as far as to say they “go to war" when referring to their workplace. We think this view is very sad and that it doesn’t make any sense. To us, work and fun are almost synonyms. We mix everything, and at times, find ourselves playing throughout the day and working at night. We tend to say we have this “awesomeness” that in no way can be lost or sacrificed. There’s something different here, that no one wants to forget and we all really enjoy. We really appreciate being together and playing together while creating. In the office, we have a pinball machine, R/C cars & helicopters, and other stuff like sweets, snacks, sodas, beer and Red Bull.
